# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

In college and later in Honduras I worked on a project whose goal was to design and build gravity-powered water treatment plants. 
At the moment the student team at Cornell ([AguaClara](http://aguaclara.cornell.edu/)) is working on updating the way in which plant designs 
are produced. Previously, designs were made by running a program in Mathcad which produced a text file that was a list of AutoCAD commands, 
which were copied and pasted into AutoCAD to draw a 3D model. This methodology was unsustainable for lots of reasons, and so the 
team is implementing a new solution wherein hydraulic designs are produced in Python and then specs are passed to 
[Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) to create a parametrized 3D model. I am fuzzy on how how far the team has gotten on this so far, 
but I think there's a ways to go. I'm hoping I can implement a full design in Python and Onshape of one part of the plant--maybe the filters. 
I'll be talking to the students/advisor soon to define a clearer scope. The team's repo as it stands currently is 
[here](https://github.com/AguaClara/aguaclara). 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I do not plan on collaborating with classmates. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I don't have any questions yet, but I probably will after I've figured out more clearly what I am doing!
