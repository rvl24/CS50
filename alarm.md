# False Alarm

## Questions

2.1. There appear to be four options in the category "TEST Message". The first
     three make sense, but the last is NOT a message that should be tested, not, like,
     by sending it to everyone, anyways, and it should not be grouped with the first 
     three.

2.2. I think the human made a perfectly reasonable mistake based on the design of the UI. 

2.3a. Reorganize the options in this form so that the "not a drill" option is not 
      grouped with the test options. 

2.3b. Make the "not a drill" option stylistically different from the test messages, like bright
      red or something

2.3c. Display an alert if the "for-real" option is selected, so that the user has 
      to confirm the selection to submit the form. 

2.4. SQL might store all possible messages to be sent out, and deliver the 
     appropriate message based on an option selected in a form. 

2.5. The user could find themself in the section dedicated to real emergency messages,
     maybe miss the header identifying it as such; perhaps overlook the stylistic
     differences, not having much of an eye for design; select the real emergency
     message; completely ignore the alert box, since those damn things are always
     popping up these days, carelessly selecting "Yes, this is a real emergency",
     and launch that message to the whole state of Hawaii.
