# Memes

## Questions

5.1. The post the comment is associated with, the user who wrote it, and the text
     of the comment itself.
     

5.2. Each comment could have a column whith the ID of the thing it's responding to--
     comments directly on the post would have the ID of the post itself, and any
     comment that responds to another comment would have the ID of that comment. 

5.3. See `memes.html`.
