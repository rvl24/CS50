# It Terns Out

## Questions

3.1. 4 bits. 

3.2. 3 trits. 

3.3. 4 distinct values. 

3.4. 27 distinct values. 

3.5. 26 is the largest number that can be represented in balanced ternary with 3 trits. 

3.6. -26 is the largest number that can be represented in balanced ternary with 3 trits. 

3.7. +-0--

3.8. Each trit could be represented by two transistors, such that three states would 
     exist: both off, both on, and one on and one off. Which one of the two was on
     would have to be arbitrary; else you'd have four states.
