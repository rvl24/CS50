## Questions

10.1. An array, being stored contiguously in memory, allows for indexing--quickly 
      looking up a value by knowing its place in the list--so you could just create
      an array that was much larger than you needed and then index through it while
      adding values to the empty spots at the back. 

10.2. A linked list can easily grow and shrink in size, so you wouldn't waste space
      creating an excessively big array. Values are easy to retrieve from the 
      beginning of the list. 

10.3. A python list can grow and shrink indefinitely and remain indexed, so the 
      perks of arrays and linked lists in C are combined. 

10.4. I imagine a C implementation would be faster, just because Python, as an 
      interpreted language, is just generally slower. 

10.5. q.append(s); q.remove(s).
